# SMI React App Starter Kit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Before you begin

Mott MacDonald Smart Infrastructure uses `Proxima Nova` and `iAWriterDuospace` fonts.
The fonts are not shipped with this kit - please contact your marketing team to get access to the font files.

Preferrably, only include `.woff` and `.woff2` fonts in the `fonts` folder.
Please update `index.scss` file once the files are included.

If you'd like to use different fonts, please refer to the UI Kit's customization / theming guide.

## Managing Credentials

Never check credentials (passwords, api keys, secrets, production API endpoints) into git! Use environment variables instead!

Learn how to use environment variables here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables

## Available Scripts

To start the app in development mode:

```
$ yarn start

# OR
